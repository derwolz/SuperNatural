# SuperNatural
# This is a bit of a test project for a board game that I have been working on
# It's a simple Console apllication game with Explicit Controls.
# It will likely be hard to find how to get around the town until a future update when I leave the Console
# players collect and research clues to find the Identity of the Monster
# Then engage the monster in combat to rid the town of its evil
# Monsters when revealed have special abilities to make the game more unique
